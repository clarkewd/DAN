The PSD file is only for visual guide. forside-03.html, junior-suites-alt.html, rooms.html and location.html are the latest html page. 
There has been some inconsistencies from PSD file to HTML. F.x. global top navigation, intro text color in rooms and so on, but the HTML file is the latest file, which lars also confirmed.

Plugins:
There are several plugins I used, some of them are quite known, but some of them are just really for quick presentation, so if there are better and quicker ones, please add on.
1. semantic gs, a css percentage grid framework. can be found in css/grid.less
2. normalize.css, used in css/normalize.css
3. flex slider, a responsive and cross platforms carousel plugin. can be found in scripts/jquery.flexslider.js.
4. modernizer, to recognize what feature browsers have.

I am using less framework to preprocess css file.
Stlye.less is the one which import all different stylings.
1. grid.less is the semantic gs framework.
2. elements is a small plugin for less prefix and less mixing.
3. variables is where all brand color and typeface are defined.
4. bones are used for defining body and the basics.
5. typography is where I define type sizes, I use em for type sizes. (except list items)
